🧩 How It Works

1. The user enters a task in the input box and clicks “Add.”


2. Tasks appear dynamically in the list below with delete and complete options.


3. Clicking a task marks it as completed (line-through style).


4. Clicking “X” deletes the task from the list.


5. The app automatically saves tasks to local storage, so they persist even after reloading.


6. Filter buttons allow the user to view All, Completed, or Pending tasks.
